**Git Ignore** is a file with the filename ‘.gitignore’. 

In this file, all file names/extensions that should be ignored by the commit are written. This means if a file which is in the ignore file is created/changed, it will not be part of the commit/repository. 

Git ignore also allows for wildcards. (_For example, :_ ‘\*.pyc’ means all files with the ending ‘.pyc’ will be ignored.) 
There are pre-written files for specific situations and languages, like [this one](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) for Python.
