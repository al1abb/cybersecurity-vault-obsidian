Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type. For example, if an employee can access the records of other employees as well as their own, then this is horizontal privilege escalation.

Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. For example, a user might access their own account page using the following URL:

```http
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123
```

If an attacker modifies the `id` parameter value to that of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page, and the associated data and functions.

> [!NOTE] IDOR Vulnerability
> This is an example of an [[IDOR]] vulnerability. This type of vulnerability arises where user-controller parameter values are used to access resources or functions directly.

In some applications, the exploitable parameter does not have a predictable value. For example, instead of an incrementing number, an application might use globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) to identify users. This may prevent an attacker from guessing or predicting another user's identifier. However, the GUIDs belonging to other users might be disclosed elsewhere in the application where users are referenced, such as user messages or reviews.

### Horizontal to [[Vertical Privilege Escalation]]
Often, a horizontal privilege escalation attack can be turned into a vertical privilege escalation, by compromising a more privileged user. For example, a horizontal escalation might allow an attacker to reset or capture the password belonging to another user. If the attacker targets an administrative user and compromises their account, then they can gain administrative access and so perform vertical privilege escalation.

An attacker might be able to gain access to another user's account page using the parameter tampering technique already described for horizontal privilege escalation:

```http
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=456
```

If the target user is an application administrator, then the attacker will gain access to an administrative account page. This page might disclose the administrator's password or provide a means of changing it, or might provide direct access to privileged functionality.
