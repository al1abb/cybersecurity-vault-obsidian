Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a **system shell**. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

> [!example]
> Imagine a textbox in a website connected to the shell. Lets say it executes this command:
> ````bash
> grep -i $input dictionary.txt
> ````
> 
> We can modify our input so that our own command is injected instead:
> ````bash
> grep -i $input; ls # dictionary.txt
> 			  ^    ^
> 			start end
> ````
