Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a **system shell**. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

This attack differs fromÂ [[Code Injection Vulnerabilities]], in that code injection allows the attacker to add their own code that is then executed by the application. In Command Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application, which execute system commands, without the necessity of injecting code.

> [!example]
> Imagine a textbox in a website connected to the shell. Lets say it executes this command:
> ````bash
> grep -i $input dictionary.txt
> ````
> 
> We can modify our input so that our own command is injected instead:
> ````bash
> grep -i $input; ls # dictionary.txt
> 			  ^    ^
> 			start end
> ````
