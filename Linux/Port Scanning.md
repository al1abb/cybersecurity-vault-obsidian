Port scanning is a method to find open ports on a host. 

A **port** can be seen as an address for a specific service. Every computer has ports with the numbers 0 to 65535. Some services have standard ports, like HTTP/80 or SSH/22. An **open port** means that the host offers a service to the network on this port.

[[NMAP]] is a network scanner. It can do Host Discovery, Port Scanning, Version Detection (Service Detection) and a lot more.
