OpenSSL is a library for secure communication over networks. It implements the **Transport Layer Security** (TLS) and **Secure Sockets Layer** (SSL) cryptographic protocols that are, for example, used in HTTPS to secure the web traffic.

[[openssl s_client]] is the implementation of a simple client that connects to a server using SSL/TLS.
