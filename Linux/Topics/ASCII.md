In computer science, there are different encodings to represent human-readable text. 
The most basic and common one is the ‘American Standard Code for Information Interchange’ 
(**ASCII**). ASCII uses 7 bits to represent one character. 

Generally, if you were to transform [[Binary Code]] to ASCII per hand, you would first transform binary to our decimal system and look up the corresponding letter in an ASCII table. 
_Example: ‘01000001’ -> ‘65’ -> ‘A’_
