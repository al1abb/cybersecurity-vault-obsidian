**Cronjobs**Â are programs running automatically at regular intervals. 

In Linux, there are multiple folders that can contain these cronjobs: cron.d, cron.daily, cron.hourly, cron.monthly, crontab, cron.weekly. The folders contain files with instructions on how the programs are run. 

It starts with the first five columns, which indicate at what time/interval the program should be done. Next is the command/program that is to be executed.
