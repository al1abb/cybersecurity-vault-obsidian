GDB stands for GNU Project Debugger and is a powerful debugging tool for C (along with other languages like C++). It helps you to poke around inside your C programs while they are executing and also allows you to see what exactly happens when your program crashes. GDB operates on executable files which are binary files produced by the compilation process.

### `gdb` — GNU Debugger

**Default Usage**
	`gdb [program]` = Where `[program]` is the executable file you want to debug.

**Basic Commands**

- `run`: Starts the program being debugged.
- `break [function]`: Sets a breakpoint at the specified function.
- `continue`: Continues execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.
- `next`: Executes the next line of code, stepping over functions.
- `step`: Executes the next line of code, stepping into functions.
- `print [expression]`: Evaluates and prints the value of the expression.
- `backtrace`: Shows the call stack, useful for understanding the sequence of function calls leading to the current point in the program.
- `quit`: Exits gdb.

**Advanced Features**

- `set variable [variable] = [value]`: Sets the value of a variable.
- `watch [expression]`: Sets a watchpoint that triggers when the expression changes.
- `info locals`: Displays local variables in the current scope.
- `info registers`: Shows the values of CPU registers.
- `list`: Shows source code around the current execution point.
- `set logging on`: Starts logging gdb commands and output to a file.
- `set logging off`: Stops logging.

**Common Options**

- `-ex [command]`: Execute gdb command before starting the program.
- `-args [arguments]`: Pass arguments to the program being debugged.
- `-g`: Include debugging information in the compiled program.
