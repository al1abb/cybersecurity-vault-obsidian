### `Ghidra` — Software Reverse Engineering Tool.

**Default Usage**

1. **Installation**: Download and install Ghidra from the official website.
2. **Launching Ghidra**: Open Ghidra by running the executable file. You will be greeted with the main window where you can start a new project or open an existing one.

**PROJECT SETUP**

- **New Project**: Click on "File" > "New Project" to create a new project. You'll need to specify the project name, location, and the target platform (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.).
- **Open Project**: To open an existing project, click on "File" > "Open Project" and navigate to the project directory.

**ANALYZING A BINARY**

1. **Importing a Binary**: Go to "File" > "Import File" and select the binary file you want to analyze.
2. **Decompile**: Once the binary is imported, you can start decompiling it by right-clicking on the imported file in the "Project Window" and selecting "Analyze". This process may take some time depending on the size and complexity of the binary.

**KEY FEATURES AND OPTIONS**

- **Code Browser**: The Code Browser allows you to navigate through the decompiled code, making it easier to understand the functionality of the binary.
- **Listing Window**: Displays the disassembled code, which is useful for low-level analysis.
- **Graph Window**: Shows the control flow graph of the program, helping to visualize how different parts of the code interact.
- **Script Manager**: Ghidra supports scripting for automating tasks. You can write scripts in Java or Python to extend Ghidra's capabilities.
- **Symbol Table**: Lists all symbols found in the binary, such as functions, variables, and data structures.
- **Cross References**: Shows where a particular function or variable is referenced in the code, aiding in understanding dependencies and relationships.

**ADVANCED USAGE**

- **Scripting**: Ghidra's scripting API allows for automation of repetitive tasks, such as scanning for specific patterns or analyzing large numbers of binaries.
- **Plugins**: Ghidra supports plugins that extend its functionality. You can download and install plugins from the official website or community repositories.
