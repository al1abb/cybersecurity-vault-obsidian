The **README** file is often found in a git repository. It is used as an overview of all the files in a directory or the git project. When creating a git project, a README file is helpful to remember what the project is about, as well as other information that users and developers might need. For example, a short explanation of the project, configuration and installation instructions, licensing information and more.
